# My scarpet scripts

## DiscordBot
This script mirrors chat between discord and minceraft. Works with multiple servers using the same room and even mirros chats across servers using the same room. Also posts player activity and server start/stop. Uses the world folder name as world name by default. For a prittier list of players specify the world as well using `!list world=MyWorld`.  
Requires [Discarpet](https://github.com/replaceitem/carpet-discarpet)

## CS
This is an enhanced version of the classic `/cs` script for switching between Spectator and Survival, resetting the player uppon switching back to survival. This version saves the required information into a file, so it works after rebooting the server as well.
