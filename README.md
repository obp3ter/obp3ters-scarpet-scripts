# My scarpet scripts

## DiscordBot
This script mirrors chat between discord and minceraft. Works with multiple servers using the same room and even mirros chats across servers using the same bot. Also posts player activity and server start/stop. Uses the world folder name as world name by default. Requires [Discarpet](https://github.com/replaceitem/carpet-discarpet)

## CS
This is an enhancedversion of the classic /cs script for switching between Spectator and Survival, resetting the player uppon switching back to survival. This version saves the required information into a file, so it works after rebooting the server as well. Requires [Scarpet Os Utils](https://github.com/obp3ter/scarpet-os-utils) *I only tested it using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Windows 10 Pro(with WSL set up)*
